# Advanced-thermal-protection
Designed to monitor the condition and protect heat generating devices, mechanisms (motors, transformers, engines, furnaces, boilers, chemical or even nuclear reactors, and much more).
Most devices are equipped with built-in temperature sensors (contact bimetallic breakers, for example), which are triggered at a certain temperature value. Due to their proximity to the source of heat generation
(for example, location in the middle of the electric motor winding), they cope well with the task of thermal protection, but this largely concerns only fire safety; the heat-generating device itself or nearby
equipment is most often hopelessly damaged. Naturally, the idea arises to create a “advanced” temperature sensor that triggers or at least notifies in advance, i.e. before irreparable destruction of the equipment occurs.
In 2020, Lyubomir Govda applied the idea of monitoring temperature changes over time and recording emergency or critical conditions based on this parameter. He made a sample of the device, the NTC temperature sensor was
mounted with a clamp to the magnetic core of a 600-watt AC transformer. The emergency factor was a short circuit in the secondary winding. By adjusting the settings, it was possible to achieve the trigger of the comparator in 4-5 seconds
after a short circuit. At the same time, the temperature of the motor surface only manages to increase by 1-2 degrees C. However, the fundamental disadvantages of this scheme were identified - strong dependence on external 
influences - external flows of warm/cold air, exposure to sunlight, influence of electric heating devices. In the process of developing the concept, the idea arose to use the principle of measuring directed heat flows, which will be discussed later.
